# BalboaSpaComms
C++/ Windows code to communicate with Balboa Spas

Currently at Proof of Concept stage.
 - Comms library can:
	- discover spas on the local network
	- Read Spa status info
	- control pumps, lights
	- set time
	- set temp, temp scale and temp range.
 - UI is non-eistent at this stage.  Program is a console mode test framework I'm using to test the comms library.
